# MapBoxTiles

# Intro

In this lab, we created tiles using the QMetaTiles plugin on QGIS. I chose a zoom level of 6 for this map because it shows the entire USA which is want I want as my geographic area. This map shows points for where the fast food restaurants in US are. I used the csv file from this [website](https://www.fastfoodmaps.com), the file is from 2007 so it might be outdated.

I also used a map that I created on Mapbox.
